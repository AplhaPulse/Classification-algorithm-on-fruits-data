Classification Algorithm Implementations

This repository provides Python implementations of various classification algorithms for machine learning tasks.

Purpose:
* Implements common classification algorithms for predictive modeling.
* Facilitates understanding and application of classification techniques.
* Provides tools for model training and evaluation.

Implementation:
* Uses Python libraries like scikit-learn for efficient implementations.
* Offers functions for training, predicting, and evaluating models.
* Includes examples for various datasets and use cases.
* Supports common evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

Usage:
* Install dependencies (e.g., pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas).
* Load and preprocess your dataset.
* Choose and train a classification model.
* Evaluate the model's performance.
* Visualize results (if applicable).

Key Concepts:
* Supervised Learning: Training models with labeled data.
* Feature Engineering: Preparing input features for the model.
* Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance with metrics.
* Classification Boundaries: Understanding how models separate classes.

Output:
* Trained classification models.
* Model performance metrics.
* Visualization of results (if applicable).
